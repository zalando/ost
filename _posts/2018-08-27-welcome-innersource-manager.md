We are very excited to have [Hong Phuc Dang](https://twitter.com/hpdang) joining our Open Source Team as the new InnerSource Manager. She will be responsible for designing and implementing InnerSource programs and will support the team to execute various open source activities. With her broad experiences, we believe Hong will add a significant value to the open source team.
